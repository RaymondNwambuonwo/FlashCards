# FlashCards
This project was based upon combining our HTML, CSS, & Javascript skills to build a game from the options we were given. I chose the game called **Flash Cards**.

## About Flash Cards
The game flashcards is somewhat of a memory quiz style game. The objective of the game is to have a card with information on the front and back. On one side of the card you will have a question or something to that effect, and on the other side will be the corresponding information for the information on the other side (question on one side, answer on the other). Once the player answers correctly, the answer side of the card will reveal itself, virtually speaking since this is the computer based version.
